What the hell?

5
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,819
There are pictures all over the internet

00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:33,438
of Security dragging
you out of the office.

7
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,359
What happened?

8
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:37,528
They wanted to change Pooka.

9
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,778
And I can't have that.

10
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,459
They just don't understand.

11
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,709
You can't improve perfection.

12
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,418
Perfection!

13
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,628
Well, that's just great.

14
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:52,918
That's just fucking great.

15
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,459
Go and get yourself fired

16
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,509
because they changed your stupid toy?

17
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:59,338
Stupid toy.

18
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,929
Why are you even working on that thing?

19
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,929
They can't make Pooka without me.

20
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,098
Pooka and I are one.

21
00:02:09,189 --> 00:02:11,769
No! No, no, don't hurt him!

22
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:12,899
No, no, no, it's okay, it's okay,

23
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,318
you didn't do anything wrong.

24
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,778
You didn't do anything wrong.

25
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,399
He just doesn't understand.

26
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,359
Understand.

27
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,818
Are you for real?

28
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,977
Now, you have officially lost your mind.

29
00:02:22,978 --> 00:02:25,158
You have gone insane!

30
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:27,908

- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, we won't charge

00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:37,058
- that much rent.
- Oh, he's kidding.

00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:33,658
He's my friend from when I was your age.

85
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,908
Hi, kiddo.

86
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:37,199
He's gonna be staying

87
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,879
with us for a few months,
just until things, like, blow over.

88

He doesn't look like he
shot himself in the foot.

00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,401
Okay!

90
00:06:45,403 --> 00:06:47,379
Hey, Becky, remember
to check her closet,

91
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:48,928
or else you're never
gonna get her to sleep.

92
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,048
- Right.
- Bye, kiddo.

93
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,098
Wait, you didn't say bye to Jenni!

94
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,159
Oh, I'm sorry.

95
00:06:54,161 --> 00:06:55,389

96
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:56,808
That's an imaginary friend.

97
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,058
I don't get it.

98
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,478
It figures Molly's kid would
have an imaginary friend.

99
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,728
- Right.
- What?

100
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,228
So, where are we going?

101
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:11,855
Wow. This place has not changed at all

102
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:13,028

103
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:14,507

104
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:17,119
It's consistent and reliable.

105
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,908

106
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,538
Bennie, holy shit!

107
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,999
What happened to you?

108
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,298
Aww!

109
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,668
What do you mean, what happened to me?

110
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,168
You lost, like a whole person here!

111
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,185
- You look good!
- Oh, thank you, man.

112
00:07:32,187 --> 00:07:33,298
Well, it's a lot of CrossFit.

113
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,494
Gotta stay competitive
when you're one of only

114
00:07:35,495 --> 00:07:37,678
five gay people in a 50-mile radius.

115
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,558
So what brings you back home, man?

116
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,367
We never thought we'd
see you again back here

117
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,728
after you left town.

118
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,019
I wouldn't call it
home, exactly, but, uh...

119
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:47,608
I just needed a little break

120
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,819
from New York, and Matt
and Molly graciously

121
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:51,019
decided to put up with me.

122
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:53,151
Now, what are you talking about?

123
00:07:53,153 --> 00:07:55,737
We have been trying to get
you to come back for years.

124
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,238
He even got a job at SCI.

125
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,831
Yeah. Remember when we thought

126
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:01,658
that English degree would
never amount to anything?

127
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,119
Now he's working for Pooka!

128
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,401
You get to write about Pooka!

129
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:07,555
Hey, you know who else works at SCI?

130
00:08:07,557 --> 00:08:08,750
Hm.

131
00:08:08,752 --> 00:08:10,814
Susan.

132
00:08:10,815 --> 00:08:12,298
Susan!

133
00:08:13,384 --> 00:08:16,225
Thanks for the heads-up, Moll.

134
00:08:16,228 --> 00:08:19,425
Yeah, we broke up, like, a decade ago.

135
00:08:19,427 --> 00:08:20,569
I'm pretty sure she moved on.

136
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:23,809
Yeah, but Derrick, though,
real talk, she has aged so well.

137
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,059
Oh my God, Matt, what...

138
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,858
No, I mean, and so have you!

139
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,189
- We have all aged very well.
- Matt, good luck with that.

140
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:32,649
Hey, but seriously, is that
your black sedan out front?

141
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:34,239
It's been reported stolen.

142
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,318
I ran the plates and it's
registered under your name

143
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:39,119
so I'm gonna assume you
didn't steal your own car?

144
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,408
Yeah, probably someone from my, um,

145
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:42,999
online fan club.

146
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,288
Huh, that's a weird
thing for a fan to do.

147
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:46,709
Listen, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to

148
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,499
bring you down to the station
tomorrow and sort it out.

149
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,379
Yeah, no problem.

150
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:51,759
Uh, I gotta get back on patrol,

151
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:53,469
but can we all hang out tomorrow?

152
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,110
- It'll be like the old times.
- Yeah, yeah.

153
00:08:55,111 --> 00:08:56,639
Come by the house around 7:00, huh?

154
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:57,719
All right.

155
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,969
Gimme an excuse to get dolled-up.

156
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,808
Bye.

157
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,688
He has no idea how
good he looks, does he?

158
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,558
- Completely oblivious.
- Got it.

159
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,899
Mm-hm! Round two.

160
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,068
So how are you guys doing?

161
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,318
Uh, we're okay.

162
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,318
Matt's still working
at the car dealership

163
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,239
and still watches nothing but football.

164
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,578
I still have the boutique.

165
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,448
Yeah, same old, same old.

166
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,788
It's all very fine.

167
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:29,168
Very Spring Valley, you mean.

168
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,499
Honestly, I'm really glad you're here.

169
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,798
I needed a change too.

170
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,125
Hey, Molls, we gotta go.

171
00:09:35,126 --> 00:09:37,219
Lauren had another
one of her nightmares.

172
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,838
You know, I blame her
imagination on you.

173
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,799
Yeah, well, she definitely
didn't get it from you.

174
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,861
Oh! Hey.

175
00:09:44,864 --> 00:09:47,138
Sorry, Mrs. C., I couldn't
get her to go back to sleep.

176
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:48,769
Hey, baby!

177
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:50,308
What happened?

178
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:52,442
I'm scared all the
bears are going to die

179
00:09:52,445 --> 00:09:55,036
because global warming
is destroying our planet

180
00:09:55,038 --> 00:09:56,899
and they can't hibernate!

181
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:58,466
She wanted to hear a bedtime story

182
00:09:58,469 --> 00:09:59,698
but it freaked her out.

183
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,448
Oh, you mean that nature one?

184
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,429
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I like to change

185
00:10:03,432 --> 00:10:05,869
the ending on that one,
it gets weirdly dark.

186
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,288
- Oh.
- Well, thanks, Becky,

187
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:08,328
you can take off if you want.

188
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,788
Thanks. Sorry again.

189
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:12,879
Ah!

190
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,339
See you around, squirt!

191
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,548
All right, bug, let's
get you to bed, huh?

192
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:20,178
Come on, I'll be your bear, come on.

193
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:25,269
- Say goodnight to Derrick!
- Goodnight.

194
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:26,519
Hey, I'll show you to your room.

195
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,519
You get to stay in Matt's man cave.

196
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,869
What up, Jaxers?

197
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,418
It's ya boy, Jax.

198
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:52,999
Back at it again with another video,

199
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,499
you already know what's good.

200
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,879
Got a quick lil' update
about that doucher, Derdick.

201
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,589
He is now officially cancelled!

202
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,139
Oh, baby!

203
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:05,726
So shout-out to you all for
making sure everyone knows

204
00:11:05,729 --> 00:11:07,889
how much of a loser wannabe he is.

205
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:11,269
No one messes with
Jax, baby, mm, mm, mm.

206
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:13,229
Anyways, just gonna leave
a little friendly reminder

207
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,822
of all his socials on the screen

208
00:11:14,825 --> 00:11:17,438
if you wanna say, like,
hi, you know, or whatever.

209
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:22,278
Jax out, baby.

210
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:24,698
_

211
00:11:33,921 --> 00:11:35,379
Here we go.

212
00:11:36,184 --> 00:11:38,207
_

213
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:49,678
So you're the new guy.

214
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:51,849
Susan!

215
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,649
We have gotta stop meeting like this!

216
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:55,859
Well, you know,

217
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,528
- I was here first, so...
- Ah, yes.

218
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:02,658
Ooh, so since Kathy is talking to Jim,

219
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:04,354
I'm guessing that everyone's gonna know

220
00:12:04,355 --> 00:12:06,466
about that whole Internet pariah thing

221
00:12:06,469 --> 00:12:08,078
by, like, lunch.

222
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,698
Is there anyone on this
planet who doesn't know?

223
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,620
I mean, you were trending.

224
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,418
Susan!

225
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:16,958
Crazy thing.

226
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,411
I still don't have the new Pooka design

227
00:12:19,413 --> 00:12:21,168
on my desk yet!

228
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:22,418
You know, the unveiling's next week.

229
00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:25,298
Were you... planning
to do that today, or...

230
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:28,389
Yes, yes; sorry, sir, it's on the way.

231
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:30,719
You're the new copywriter, huh?

232
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,488
Well, it's nice that
the company's taking on

233
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,269
a #charitycase.

234
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:38,359
Just try to keep a low profile, huh?

235
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,097
Get him started on my speech ASAP.

236
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,688
Mm-hm.

237
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,109
- Who is he?
- Amir.

238
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,052
He's the general manager.

239
00:12:45,053 --> 00:12:48,582
He's been up my ass about
this whole Pooka redesign

240
00:12:48,585 --> 00:12:49,658
we're launching next week.

241
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:52,038
But if you have any questions,
I'm over in Marketing.

242
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:56,957
We're, like, somewhere over
in that general vicinity.

243
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,499
By the other generic cubicles?

244
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,749
- Yeah.
- Got it.

245
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,048
Cool.

246
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:02,969
See you around, stranger.

247
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,799
See you around, stranger.

248
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,749
Boo!

249
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,249
Whoa, dude!

250
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,999
Chill out!

251
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,459
I was just messing with you.

252
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,879
What is happening?

253
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:44,209
Name's Andy.

254
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,178
I'm in charge of social media.

255
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:49,469
Had to get some promo shots
with the OG Pooka here for Insta.

256
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:53,808
Wait.

257
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:55,229
I recognize you.

258
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,438
You... you're the new copywriter?

259
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,729
Yeah.

260
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,019
- That's me.
- Cool.

261
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:02,818
That means you work for me.

262
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,698
Wow.

263
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,908
You are...

264
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:10,158
very young.

265
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:12,028
Yeah. Got fast-tracked.

266
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:15,538
Dad's an associate regional manager!

267
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:17,958
So that's the original Pooka doll?

268
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,328
Yeah, the one and only.

269
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:24,129
You know the story about the
chick who created it, right?

270
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:25,759
No.

271
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,509
She went nuts,

272
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:29,678
killed her husband,

273
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:32,889
and lit herself on fire.

274
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:35,969
Really?

275
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,178
Yup.

276
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:38,389
Fucked-up, huh?

277
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,229
Hey, anyway, peace out, Derrick.

278
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,029
_

279
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:02,208
What up, Jaxers?

280
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,958
It's ya boy, Jax,

281
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,999
comin' at you with some hot goss.

282
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,548
But first, a very special shout-out

283
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:11,469
to a truly dedicated
Jaxer for trackin' down

284
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,844
our favorite loser.

285
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:15,058
Aww, poor Derdick!

286
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:16,428
Looks like he went a little wee-wee

287
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:18,139
and ran all the way back home!

288
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,058
I think it's my duty to give him a, uh,

289
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:23,859
very special homecoming.

290
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,479
So if there are any Jaxers
in the Spring Valley area,

291
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,740
make sure to do your very
best to welcome him back.

292
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,408
Hey. What are you doing back?

293
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:36,538
Some asshat fucked with my car.

294
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:38,828
Oh.

295
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,908
- "You sux"?
- Right?

296
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:42,209
If you're gonna insult a writer,

297
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,788
at least use proper grammar.

298
00:15:44,789 --> 00:15:46,548
You gonna go to HR?

299
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:48,048
What happened to keeping a low profile?

300
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:50,088
Maybe you're right.

301
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,048
Well, either way, I'll see you tonight.

302
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:53,588
Tonight?

303
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,219
Yeah, at your welcome home party.

304
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,599
Molly texted me about it?

305
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,099
Oh... was that a surprise?

306
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,100
To me, it was.

307
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,849
Oops. Um...

308
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,229
well, see ya there.

309
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,609
Yeah. Bring alcohol.

310
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,318
- Please, yeah.
- Okay, yeah.

311
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,208
Remember that time

312
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:24,078
when we, uh, tried to
TP Mrs. Kruger's house?

313
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,379
We tried to TP her place

314
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:27,168
but you couldn't get the
TP roll over the tree.

315
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:28,249
You know what?

316
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,958
Matt was the athlete, not me, right?

317
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,298
I had the muscles to take
it over the top, baby!

318
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:35,219
- Had.
- Aww!

319
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,523
Hey, Bennie, you might wanna
take it easy on those brownies.

320
00:16:37,524 --> 00:16:39,349
They're, uh, Molly's special recipe.

321
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,389
Mm! Honestly, these are fantastic!

322
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:43,229
No, it...

323
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,558
You put weed in here?

324
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:46,229
- Yes!
- No! I can't get high!

325
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,359
- I'm a sheriff's deputy.
- Sorry!

326
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,649
Oh, what the hell.

327
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:51,772
So good.

328
00:16:51,774 --> 00:16:53,296
You guys, this is so much fun.

329
00:16:53,298 --> 00:16:55,149
It's just like when we were kids, right?

330
00:16:55,152 --> 00:16:56,658
This is making me miss being 16.

331
00:16:56,659 --> 00:16:59,119
- I just wanna be 16 again.
- Are you kidding me?

332
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,109
Do you know how awful it would
be to be a teenager now, okay?

333
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,377
Social media's the worst invention ever.

334
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,749
All right, I can't do it.

335
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,249
Everyone's dancing around the issue

336
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,548
and I have no idea what's going on,

337
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:11,959
so I gotta ask, Derrick,

338
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,509
what is it with you
and the internet thing?

339
00:17:13,509 --> 00:17:15,548
- Bennie!
- No, it's fine.

340
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:17,298
Figures Bennie wouldn't know.

341
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:21,378
I, um, wrote a book
about online personalities

342
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:24,573
that pissed off one of
the biggest influencers

343
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:28,688
on the internet, some
douchebag named Jax.

344
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,229
I'm sorry, man.

345
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,068
I know he's ruining your life, but...

346
00:17:32,069 --> 00:17:35,568
Jax puts out the funniest videos.

347
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,118
- Mm... um...
- _

348
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,199
Wait, didn't his videos hurt kids?

349
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,459
Like, they were eating marbles
and, like, rupturing colons?

350
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,209
Yeah... kids, adults,
a lot of people did it.

351
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,338
Like, a lot of people do it,
like, all kinds of people,

352
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:52,459
adults too.

353
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,838
Um... so what happened?

354
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:58,888
He made it his mission to ruin my life.

355
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:02,679
Sent his horde to crucify
me on social media,

356
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,348
flooded online sites with bad reviews,

357
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:09,558
boycotted my publisher, killed sales.

358
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:11,990
He, uh, destroyed my career.

359
00:18:11,992 --> 00:18:15,239
All that work was just
erased from existence.

360
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,148
Might as well have been dead.

361
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,159
Dead!

362
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,949
Oh!

363
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,868
Mom? I had a nightmare.

364
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,459
Oh, baby, come over here.

365
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,578
Was it about pomegranates again?

366
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:30,628
Look, I know those seeds are weird,

367
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,959
but it's just a fruit, I promise.

368
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,459
No, it was Momo.

369
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,969
Oh, sweetie is that, like, a K-pop band?

370
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,969
Uh, no, not exactly.

371
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:43,429
Momo is a dumb, scary-looking doll thing

372
00:18:43,431 --> 00:18:45,888
with big bug eyes, right?

373
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,808
Oh yeah, Kathy sent that to me.

374
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:49,439
Bunch of kids made up a story

375
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,237
that if you don't do what Momo says,

376
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:53,689
- she'll make you...
- Mm... mm...

377
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,608
- do... do bad things.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

378
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:57,028
So, someone sent it to Matt

379
00:18:57,029 --> 00:19:00,358
and he accidentally showed
it to a certain little girl.

380
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:02,239
All right, let's get you to bed before

381
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,239
Mommy sics Momo on both of us.

382
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,299
Say goodnight!

383
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,909
Goodnight, everybody,
let's go, let's go...

384
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,249
All right, bug, goodnight, muah!

385
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,128
Don't forget Jenni!

386
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,338
You know Jenni's not real, right?

387
00:19:15,339 --> 00:19:16,959
Don't listen to him, Jenni.

388
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,588
Mom says we can manifest
ethereal entities

389
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:22,219
with our psychic energies.

390
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,259
Right. Okay.

391
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:26,969
Uh, goodnight, Jenni, muah!

392
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,429
Don't keep her up too late, okay?

393
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,858
She is just like
I was when I was little.

394
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:36,148
Weird as fuck?

395
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:43,449
So what's with the whole
murder-suicide thing in Pooka?

396
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,159
You didn't hear about
what happened last year?

397
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,078
It was Ellie Burgis.

398
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:49,788
Do you remember her?
She was in our class.

399
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:53,499
She used to sit in the back
row and, like, eat her own hair?

400
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,322
Oh, Ellie Burgess!

401
00:19:55,324 --> 00:19:57,209
Yeah, Ellie Burgess and
I went on a couple dates

402
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,338
back in the day.

403
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:00,669
Talk about a bullet dodged.

404
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,939
She actually came up
with the idea for the doll

405
00:20:02,941 --> 00:20:04,009
when she was working in Accounting.

406
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:06,178
The company bought it
off of her, but then

407
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,638
they wanted to do a
remodel to spruce it up

408
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,388
and she went berserk

409
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:15,009
and Security had to, like,
escort her out of the building

410
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,229
and she did it that night.

411
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,088
You know, I was the one
that got called to the scene

412
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,122
that night.

413
00:20:21,124 --> 00:20:22,989
- I don't wanna hear about this.
- Oh, I wanna hear about that.

414
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,818
- Come on.
- No!

415
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:26,963
Well, we needed forensics to tell

416
00:20:26,965 --> 00:20:28,788
the bodies apart because
they were so charred.

417
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:30,249
You wanna know the creepiest part?

418
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,159
Because that wasn't creepy enough?

419
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,578
She was wearing a Pooka
mask when she did it

420
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:36,709
and it melted to her face.

421
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:41,669
Bennie! Why do you
have that on your phone?

422
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:44,378
You brought that up so fast!

423
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,659
What would make someone do that?

424
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,366
Hey, use the doorbell!

425
00:20:54,368 --> 00:20:56,229
- Jesus Christ!
- No, I got it, I got it.

426
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,769
- Okay.
- God.

427
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,568
You suck, Derdick!

428
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:06,989
What is going on?

429
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,949
Well, bad news, Matt and Molly.

430
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:12,868
Apparently, the Jackoffs
know where I'm staying.

431
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,999
Maybe you should send Momo after them.

432
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,798
Or Ellie, huh?

433
00:21:22,339 --> 00:21:24,164
Right? Just imagine just a crazy chick

434
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,755
in a melted Pooka mask.

435
00:21:25,757 --> 00:21:28,179
That's scarier than Momo.

436
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,429
What if we did that?

437
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,009
Did what?

438
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:32,969
What if we made our own Momo?

439
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,733
But for adults, based on Ellie?

440
00:21:35,736 --> 00:21:37,692
You know, really fuck
with other people online

441
00:21:37,693 --> 00:21:40,068
for a change, especially Jax.

442
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:41,898
We could go viral.

443
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,439
But how do you make it, you
know, spread on the internet?

444
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,318
Oh, people love
to join in on stupid shit.

445
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:48,449
We just come up with
some ridiculous ritual

446
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,249
that you can do to summon Pooka.

447
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,159
It'll be like Bloody Mary
meets the ice bucket challenge.

448
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,328
Okay, okay, what could the ritual be?

449
00:21:55,329 --> 00:21:57,368
Well, if it's involving Pooka,

450
00:21:57,369 --> 00:22:00,051
maybe we have 'em do
the Pooka dance thing,

451
00:22:00,054 --> 00:22:03,321
the Pooka-see, Pooka-do
thing, like, whatever that is?

452
00:22:03,324 --> 00:22:04,731
Okay, yeah, that is kinda cute.

453
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:06,509
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
something like that, but...

454
00:22:06,509 --> 00:22:08,509
- more stupid.
- Yeah.

455
00:22:08,509 --> 00:22:10,469
Well, she burned herself alive.

456
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,808
Why don't we get people to eat
something really, really spicy?

457
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:19,123
No, the spicy food challenge stuff,

458
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:21,008
like the Hot Ones
thing, that's played out,

459
00:22:21,009 --> 00:22:22,108
that's too hacked.

460
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:24,608
But eating something,
that's always a big thing.

461
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:26,068
That's good, but what would it be?

462
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,778
What about ash?

463
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,368
Morbid. I love it, Susan.

464
00:22:36,369 --> 00:22:38,579
Thank you.

465
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:42,919
In order to do the full ceremony,

466
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,838
you eat ash, symbolizing
the Salem witch trials,

467
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:48,378
where her ancestors were punished.

468
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,638
Put on the Pooka mask
and do the Pooka dance

469
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,219
while singing the full lyrics.

470
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,759
The spell goes,

471
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:57,058
"Pooka see, Pooka do.

472
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:59,729
If you're bad, he'll come for you.

473
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:02,439
With fuzzy ears and eyes of red,

474
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,858
you'd best behave or else you're dead".

475
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:07,358
All right, I think I got it.

476
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:10,026
Ellie's fake family history
about her ancestors

477
00:23:10,028 --> 00:23:11,028
being witches,

478
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:13,938
bunch of random mysticism
courtesy of Molly.

479
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,021
- Yeah!
- Mm-hm.

480
00:23:15,023 --> 00:23:17,451
You do all of this and Pooka will judge

481
00:23:17,452 --> 00:23:18,959
if you're naughty.

482
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,459
You can even challenge
your friends to join in.

483
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,919
That's where it's at.

484
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,112
Uh, yeah, guys,

485
00:23:24,114 --> 00:23:25,958
I don't know about this.

486
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,709
That's an angry spirit
you're messing with.

487
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:30,429
Can we just not post it?

488
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:33,250
Molly, see, this is why
Lauren always has nightmares,

489
00:23:33,251 --> 00:23:34,938
'cause you talk about
this stuff like it's real.

490
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,138
Oh, come on, Molly.

491
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,479
Live a... live a little!

492
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,769
Bennie, you're so stoned!

493
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:43,858
Stop eating the brownies!

494
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:45,769
But they're delicious!

495
00:23:47,153 --> 00:23:49,278
Oh my God, you're so high!

496
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,699
But seriously...

497
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,778
I think you should post it.

498
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:54,739
Because if Amir sees it,
he will lose his shit.

499
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,249
Done.

500
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,499
Ah.

501
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,288
All right, you're finished, great.

502
00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:09,259
But this creative genius
has got to go to bed.

503
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:10,509
Finished!

504
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:14,970
Oh, I'm never getting high again.

505
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:52,686
_

506
00:24:52,689 --> 00:24:54,689
_

507
00:24:56,512 --> 00:24:58,712
_

508
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:09,387
_

509
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,390
_

510
00:25:12,421 --> 00:25:13,448
_

511
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,608
Hey, Jaxers!

512
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:16,739
It's ya boy, Jax. Ya'll
have been begging me

513
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,368
to try this whole Pooka Challenge.

514
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:20,239
Here we go. Now, if I've been naughty,

515
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,124
which, come on, I'm Jax, y'all,

516
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:26,353
Pooka will come and beat
the shit outta me, okay?

517
00:25:26,355 --> 00:25:29,959
So I've decided to risk
it all for you Jaxers.

518
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,919
Here we go.

519
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,259
Bone apple teeth!

520
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:38,388
Yecch.

521
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,929
That's nasty.

to take the challenge.

528
00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:05,709
Subscribe.

529
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,538
Yo, you have to do the Pooka Challenge.

530
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:08,709
- Even Jax did it.
- _

531
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,919
Get me a Pooka mask stat.

532
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,249
What did Jax do?

533
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:16,669
Um... it's called Google, old man.

534
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:38,907
Holy shit, we're trending!

535
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,318
Oh my God, did you see?

536
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:41,568
Yes, yes, we actually went viral!

537
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:43,328
I know, right?

538
00:26:43,329 --> 00:26:47,288
By the way, ash tastes terrible.

539
00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:49,038
What... you...

540
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,209
you actually tried it?

541
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,959
- We made it up!
- I know, I had to!

542
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,838
Kathy made everyone in the office do it.

543
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:57,088
But, you know, good work, copywriter.

544
00:26:58,453 --> 00:27:02,347
So, hey, would you maybe
wanna get dinner tomorrow?

545
00:27:02,349 --> 00:27:03,969
You know, catch up?

546
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:07,179
Oh, yeah... uh, yeah, sure.

547
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,098
Cool. Well, how 'bout Footsies?

548
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:12,479
Is that like literally the
only restaurant in town?

549
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,818
What? I love the breadsticks.

550
00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:15,858
Susan!

551
00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:17,509
- Yeah.
- We are facing a code red

552
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,567
PR crisis.

553
00:27:18,569 --> 00:27:20,318
What are you doing to help out, exactly?

554
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:23,778
I'm just giving Derrick notes
on his copy for Pooka Day.

555
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:27,828
Okay. Your little-ass pal
is the least of our worries.

556
00:27:27,829 --> 00:27:30,828
I need you to please get
your head in the game.

557
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:33,588
Mm-hm, I'm sorry,
sir, I'm... I'm coming.

558
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,798
Oh-ho-ho my God!

559
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,298
Stores are selling
out of the Pooka mask.

560
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:43,719
We better be getting a
fat royalty check for this.

561
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,888
I thought I imagined this whole thing.

562
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:48,729
Do not ever let me taste
your baked goods again, Matt.

563
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:51,348
Fuck Jax, I can't believe
he actually did it.

564
00:27:51,349 --> 00:27:53,479
Well, I mean, I did it
too 'cause, like, you know,

565
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,019
what he does, I do.

566
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:58,358
Usually, it's just...

567
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:00,179
I mean, I stay on trend, you know?

568
00:28:00,181 --> 00:28:01,540
I just try and keep up with the...

569
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,028
Oh, okay.

570
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:05,159
I got daddy duty.

571
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,278
You guys have a good time.

572
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:08,489
- Here you go, Bennie.
- Ew! Matt!

573
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,249
What? No beer left behind, right?

574
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,868
See you guys later.

575
00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:13,574
Social media influencers

576
00:28:13,576 --> 00:28:15,509
have taken the internet by storm,

577
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,588
igniting the Pooka Challenge.

578
00:28:17,589 --> 00:28:20,010
Experts are saying this
is quickly becoming

579
00:28:20,012 --> 00:28:23,378
the biggest internet
sensation of all time.

580
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:27,585
The most influential
thing I've ever written.

581
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,887
And I can't even take credit for it.

582
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:34,058
Whatever, man.

583
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:37,148
Don't these things
just blow over anyway?

584
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,439
No, no, they definitely do not.

585
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,122
I have over a half a million
followers who are trolling me

586
00:28:42,124 --> 00:28:45,909
and they are not letting it go.

587
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:48,409
- And a stalker.
- What?

588
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,499
Oh no.

589
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,078
No.

590
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:56,538
"Hey. This is Derrick's friend

591
00:28:56,539 --> 00:28:59,249
the police officer.

592
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:03,877
Now I have your cell number, asshole".

593
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,388
You're welcome.

594
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:09,179
My hero.

595
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,638
All right, well, I'm calling it.

596
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,269
I got an early shift tomorrow.

597
00:29:13,269 --> 00:29:15,348
Get home safe, bud.

598
00:29:15,349 --> 00:29:16,769
Goodnight, Officer.

599
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:20,269
Okay, so, we're gonna go to the beach,

600
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:22,148
you know, get shirtless,

601
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:24,278
and then fuck up some Pooka toys.

602
00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:27,949
Yeah. Obviously, I'm
gonna livestream it.

603
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:32,288
Wh... I'm deadass, Brad!

604
00:29:32,289 --> 00:29:34,868
Yeah, I don't care if it's littering.

605
00:29:34,869 --> 00:29:37,685
Bro, this whole Pooka thing
is getting me way more views

606
00:29:37,688 --> 00:29:39,169
than the IG pics of my abs.

607
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,169
Yeah, I know, I didn't
believe it either.

608
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:45,128
Anyways, we are riding this
wave to a new brand deal, okay?

609
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,878
Deal!

610
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,638
Fuckin' toy.

611
00:30:05,397 --> 00:30:06,630
What up, Jaxers?

612
00:30:06,632 --> 00:30:08,989
It's ya boy Jax coming to you live!

613
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,717
Just wanna say a quick little thank you

614
00:30:10,719 --> 00:30:13,118
to everyone for supporting
me on my latest video.

615
00:30:23,299 --> 00:30:26,451
Oh. Anyways, uh, just wanted to say

616
00:30:26,452 --> 00:30:28,981
I have a very, very
special treat lined up

617
00:30:28,983 --> 00:30:30,730
for all you Pooka fans, you already...

618
00:30:40,019 --> 00:30:43,105
Uh, sorry, Jaxers, just
got a little distracted.

619
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,028
What the hell?

620
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:11,429
Help!

621
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,679
Someone help me!

622
00:31:24,269 --> 00:31:25,898
Help!

623
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:38,078
Mom!

624
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:51,040
_

625
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:56,566
_

626
00:31:56,567 --> 00:32:02,067
_

627
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:21,618
Fucking influencers.

628
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,838
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

629
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:26,959
Oh my God.

630
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,259
Remember when my mom
used to drop us off here?

631
00:32:29,259 --> 00:32:31,169
Yes!

632
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,179
And those ominous warnings
she used to give us?

633
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,251
"Be safe".

634
00:32:34,253 --> 00:32:36,900
Like she thought we were just
gonna go into the bathroom

635
00:32:36,902 --> 00:32:38,388
and start bangin'.

636
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:41,519
I mean, nothing turns me
on like garlic and butter.

637
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,689
So you, uh, meeting a lot of new people?

638
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:47,318
Uh, yeah, well, I'm seeing,
like, five guys at once, so.

639
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:49,318
- Hm.
- Really mastered

640
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:51,048
playing the field here in Spring Valley.

641
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:55,107
I am very proud of you.

642
00:32:55,109 --> 00:32:57,328
But seriously, are you?

643
00:32:57,329 --> 00:32:58,368
No!

644
00:32:58,369 --> 00:33:00,199
Have you seen how busy I am?

645
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,801
Every living thing in my house dies.

646
00:33:01,804 --> 00:33:04,328
I can't commit to a human.

647
00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:09,087
So, um... you got any
ideas for your next book?

648
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:10,876
I think it's safe to say
that my writing career

649
00:33:10,878 --> 00:33:13,419
is pretty much over.

650
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,048
You can't just give up, Derrick.

651
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:16,469
You've always wanted to be a writer.

652
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,509
Yeah, well, that was before

653
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:19,429
the world thought I was an asshole.

654
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,929
Now they could care
less what I have to say.

655
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,808
So what are you gonna do?

656
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:26,461
Play it by ear.

657
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:29,575
Hopefully, this whole thing dies down

658
00:33:29,576 --> 00:33:31,796
and then I get a writing
job doing food reviews

659
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:35,239
for a little gazette in New York.

660
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,989
So you're going back there, then?

661
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,868
Maybe.

662
00:33:39,869 --> 00:33:42,038
I don't know, that's where my life was.

663
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:51,835
- So, um... aww...
- What?

664
00:33:53,016 --> 00:33:54,877
Do you ever think what would've happened

665
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,009
if we stayed together?

666
00:33:58,009 --> 00:34:00,679
Hm.

667
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,348
Well, I would be miserable in New York

668
00:34:03,349 --> 00:34:04,929
or you would be miserable here.

669
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,599
Come on.

670
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:11,318
It's New York, Susan.

671
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,108
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

672
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:17,028
I actually like it here and you don't.

673
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:21,079
All you've ever wanted
is to get out and be seen.

674
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:22,449
What does that mean?

675
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:25,409
Don't act like you don't know.

676
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:26,869
I mean, this whole thing with Jax.

677
00:34:26,871 --> 00:34:29,458
I mean, you hate it but
you're obsessed with it.

678
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,958
Why don't you just delete
your social profiles?

679
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,509
I'm just saying that what
you wanted isn't here.

680
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:40,219
And all I've ever wanted is...

681
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:42,038
What, to be in a town full of nobodies

682
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:45,809
obsessed with some
obnoxious children's toy?

683
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:51,188
So this life that you have up there,

684
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,818
how many people actually gave a shit

685
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,871
when all this went down?

686
00:34:53,873 --> 00:34:55,568
Okay, you know what? It's New York, okay?

687
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:56,681
I got dropped.

688
00:34:56,684 --> 00:34:58,318
They'll welcome me back eventually.

689
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,199
Okay, well here in Spring Valley,

690
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:02,456
there's people like Molly
who open their home to you

691
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:03,681
because they're good people.

692
00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:07,463
I mean, did you even visit
Molly when she had Lauren?

693
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,958
Yeah, I didn't think so.

694
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,708
I mean, when you left,
you just dropped all of us.

695
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,041
You got successful and
then all of a sudden

696
00:35:18,043 --> 00:35:20,889
it was like none of us
even mattered anymore.

697
00:35:20,889 --> 00:35:22,889
Until you needed us.

698
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:24,288
So don't you dare act like you're better

699
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,469
than this place.

700
00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:32,648
Hey... Susan, Susan!

701
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:33,858
I'm parked down there.

702
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,228
Okay, I'll walk you to your car.

703
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,818
No, it's cool, I got it.

704
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,739
Hey, listen, I'm sorry
about what I said before,

705
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:40,949
I didn't mean it.

706
00:35:40,949 --> 00:35:42,525
No, you did.

707
00:35:42,527 --> 00:35:44,469
And that's just who you are,

708
00:35:44,472 --> 00:35:45,789
and that's okay.

709
00:35:45,789 --> 00:35:47,704
And it was really great
catching up with you.

710
00:35:47,706 --> 00:35:49,539
I'll see you at the office.

711
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:52,378
Yeah, okay, just...

712
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,789
Bye, Susan!

713
00:36:06,278 --> 00:36:08,278
_

714
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:27,239
- Oh God, Amir, fuck Pooka!
- _

715
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,298
Andy?

716
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:51,059
"You've been naughty"?

717
00:37:36,349 --> 00:37:38,268
Oh my God.

718
00:37:38,269 --> 00:37:42,527
- Susan!
- Oh! Jesus Christ, Derrick!

719
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:43,530
What happened?

720
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:44,648
I was attacked!

721
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:46,028
Attacked? By who?

722
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,659
I don't know, I don't know what...

723
00:37:48,659 --> 00:37:50,579
Your car.

724
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:53,248
- "Naughty"?
- What?!

725
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,458
So you were attacked by someone

726
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,869
wearing a Pooka suit?

727
00:37:55,869 --> 00:37:58,039
Yeah, I think so.

728
00:37:58,039 --> 00:37:59,576
Derrick and I had just finished dinner,

729
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:02,708
and then, he was just at my car,

730
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:06,179
and he had... he had these scissors.

731
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:07,759
Like we wrote in the story.

732
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,911
And then he was just gone.

733
00:38:08,914 --> 00:38:12,387
I got a text from the stalker
just as she was being attacked.

734
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:14,728
Does someone know we posted that story?

735
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,389
Can't we just take it down, Derrick?

736
00:38:16,389 --> 00:38:19,228
I... no one knows it was actually us

737
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,268
that posted it.

738
00:38:21,269 --> 00:38:23,025
You won't delete it
because it's popular,

739
00:38:23,027 --> 00:38:24,608
won't you?

740
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,818
It's out there now.

741
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:30,068
Bennie, I mean, should
we be worried, or...

742
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,239
I don't know.

743
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:33,909
Just be careful, keep your doors locked.

744
00:38:33,909 --> 00:38:35,650
Suzie, I'm gonna take
you down to the station

745
00:38:35,652 --> 00:38:36,998
so we can file a report.

746
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,646
And I'm gonna run that number
that's been harassing you,

747
00:38:38,648 --> 00:38:39,748
see who it belongs to.

748
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:40,862
Yeah, no, thanks.

749
00:38:40,864 --> 00:38:42,338
Suzie, I'm really sorry about that.

750
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,378
Yeah.

751
00:38:46,744 --> 00:38:51,766
_

752
00:38:51,768 --> 00:38:54,467
_

753
00:38:58,519 --> 00:38:59,938
Knock, knock!

754
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,309
Hey! Molly, what's up?

755
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:04,318
I just wanted to
make sure you were okay.

756
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,688
Seemed kinda tense down
there with Susan, huh?

757
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:07,949
Yeah.

758
00:39:07,949 --> 00:39:10,449
I, uh, really fucked up.

759
00:39:12,869 --> 00:39:14,289
Started thinking maybe you were right,

760
00:39:14,289 --> 00:39:15,891
so I was checking to
see if anyone figured out

761
00:39:15,893 --> 00:39:17,248
it was us.

762
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:20,289
This thing's really taken
on a life of its own.

763
00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:21,378
What do you mean?

764
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,628
People keep adding to it,

765
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,557
saying that it has razor-sharp claws,

766
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:25,844
can teleport...

767
00:39:25,847 --> 00:39:28,717
Starting to talk about it
like it's actually real.

768
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:31,259
Well, they probably do think it's real.

769
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,090
Never underestimate
how willing people are

770
00:39:33,092 --> 00:39:34,389
to believe in something.

771
00:39:34,389 --> 00:39:35,639
Did you know in some cultures,

772
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:37,639
they actually believe
the imagination can create

773
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:39,268
things that...

774
00:39:39,269 --> 00:39:42,099
I'm gonna stop talking now.

775
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:44,148
Goodnight.

776
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,188
Hey, Moll?

777
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,302
Yep?

778
00:39:46,304 --> 00:39:47,608
You know, it's not
too late for me to get

779
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,581
a hotel room or something.
This is a lot to deal with.

780
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:51,025
You guys have done enough already.

781
00:39:51,027 --> 00:39:52,429
Are you kidding?

782
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,126
You were already chased
out of your home once.

783
00:39:54,128 --> 00:39:55,829
I am not letting that happen again.

784
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:02,119
You're a better friend
than I deserve, Moll.

785
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:03,789
Mm.

786
00:40:03,789 --> 00:40:05,918
Very true.

787
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,668
Goodnight.

788
00:40:13,219 --> 00:40:14,929
- Hey, Derdick!
- _

789
00:40:14,929 --> 00:40:16,719
- Here.
- What's this?

790
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:19,809
Some stuff Amir needs
for the big shindig tomorrow.

791
00:40:19,809 --> 00:40:22,898
Pooka 2.0, baby!

792
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,608
So, yeah, he apparently
wanted it yesterday, so.

793
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:27,358
Yesterday?

794
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,938
Thanks for the prompt delivery.

795
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,489
Hey, no sweat, dude.

796
00:40:31,489 --> 00:40:32,949
Peace out.

797
00:40:39,775 --> 00:40:43,275
_

798
00:41:13,949 --> 00:41:17,221
Hey, hey, I was...
looking for you all day.

799
00:41:17,222 --> 00:41:18,449
Is everything all right?

800
00:41:18,449 --> 00:41:20,409
Yeah, you know, just
swamped with the event.

801
00:41:20,409 --> 00:41:22,260
Yeah, I was, um, wondering

802
00:41:22,262 --> 00:41:25,498
if we could maybe try that whole...

803
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,289
dinner thing again tonight?

804
00:41:28,289 --> 00:41:29,748
I'm clearly very rusty.

805
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,807
Uh, I actually asked Molly and Matt

806
00:41:31,809 --> 00:41:36,297
if they would hang out
tonight, so, um, sorry.

807
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,259
Got it! Oh, yeah, duh.

808
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,679
I still have to finish
that whole speech thing

809
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:43,179
for your event, uh, tomorrow.

810
00:41:43,179 --> 00:41:46,728
So, um, I will see you there

811
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:47,860
at the...

812
00:41:52,795 --> 00:41:56,818
_

813
00:42:16,007 --> 00:42:21,036
_

814
00:42:23,614 --> 00:42:25,637
_

815
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:26,938
In international news,

816
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,059
Alex Butler was arrested in Berlin

817
00:42:29,059 --> 00:42:32,041
for murdering his family
after police responded

818
00:42:32,043 --> 00:42:34,688
to sounds of screaming
coming from the household.

819
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:36,818
Reports indicate there
were four victims:

820
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,858
his wife and their three children.

821
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,659
Eyewitnesses reported
that upon being arrested,

822
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:44,579
the suspect was apparently
hysterically claiming

823
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:45,949
that he was innocent

824
00:42:45,949 --> 00:42:48,458
and that a creature actually
committed the murders

825
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:51,418
after they did the
now-infamous Pooka Challenge.

826
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:54,248
We'll have more details soon.

827
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:56,378
This can't be real.

828
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:05,768
Here you go.

829
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:26,039
Pooka see, Pooka do.

830
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:28,289
If you're bad, he'll come for you.

831
00:43:28,289 --> 00:43:30,789
With furry ears and eyes of red,

832
00:43:30,789 --> 00:43:33,588
best be good or else you're dead.

833
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:03,528
Just what I thought.

834
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:07,079
You're just a stupid kids' toy.

835
00:44:34,769 --> 00:44:36,018
Fuck...

836
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:46,489
Hello?

837
00:44:54,789 --> 00:44:56,998
Andy, if that's you...

838
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,798
I'm definitely going straight to HR.

839
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:31,909
Stupid fuckin' Pooka.

840
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:40,748
Shit!

841
00:46:15,789 --> 00:46:18,418
Hey, are you all right?

842
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,338
- No!
- Swing and a miss.

843
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:23,958
Oh, hi, Derrick.

844
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,969
You do know this isn't
actually the only place in town.

845
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:30,298
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, I'm fine!

846
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,429
Everything's fine!

847
00:46:31,429 --> 00:46:34,018
I just got attacked
by a giant kids' toy!

848
00:46:34,019 --> 00:46:35,889
What, the guy from last night?

849
00:46:35,889 --> 00:46:38,478
No, no, everyone,
just... just listen to me.

850
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,268
Whatever it is that
tried to kill me, um...

851
00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:44,068
it wasn't human.

852
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,449
Uh, you okay, man, or...

853
00:46:52,449 --> 00:46:54,039
I'm serious.

854
00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:55,829
I did the ritual, and, uh...

855
00:46:57,409 --> 00:46:59,329
... I think I summoned Pooka.

856
00:46:59,329 --> 00:47:00,458
The ritual?

857
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,590
The same ritual we did the other day

858
00:47:02,592 --> 00:47:04,458
while drunk, the one
we made up completely?

859
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:06,719
Okay, okay, okay, just...

860
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:08,429
hear me out.

861
00:47:08,429 --> 00:47:11,429
What if the singing,
the dancing, the ash,

862
00:47:11,429 --> 00:47:13,889
the whole Pooka thing,

863
00:47:13,889 --> 00:47:15,331
what if it actually works?

864
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:16,679
What did I tell you?

865
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:19,099
What did I tell you guys about
fucking with angry spirits?

866
00:47:19,099 --> 00:47:20,438
Derrick, I know you're upset,

867
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,568
- but listen to yourself...
- I know what I saw!

868
00:47:29,789 --> 00:47:32,021
Okay, your parents just called,

869
00:47:32,023 --> 00:47:33,528
so they're on their way home.

870
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:35,199
That means bedtime.

871
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:37,699
But you said you'd tell us a story.

872
00:47:37,699 --> 00:47:40,579
Yeah, well, last time
I read you and Jenni something,

873
00:47:40,579 --> 00:47:42,539
your parents almost fired me.

874
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:49,009
You want your Pooka doll?

875
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:51,429
What, why not? You love Pooka.

876
00:47:51,429 --> 00:47:54,219
It's going to get me.

877
00:47:54,219 --> 00:47:57,059
Don't tell me you're
scared of that viral thing.

878
00:47:57,059 --> 00:48:00,018
Lauren, you're getting too
old for this kind of stuff.

879
00:48:00,019 --> 00:48:02,398
Here.

880
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,268
I'll prove to you...

881
00:48:05,269 --> 00:48:08,108
there's nothing to be afraid of.

882
00:48:37,639 --> 00:48:39,978
Naughty?

883
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:46,438
Mrs. C, are you home?

884
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:53,608
Lauren, is that you?

885
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:49,958
Becky, we're home.

886
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,719
- I'll check upstairs.
- Yeah.

887
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:56,429
Becky?

888
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:07,518
She's not up there.

889
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:08,938
What? I just talked to her.

890
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:09,940
Did she leave?

891
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,068
I don't know, maybe she bailed.

892
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:13,188
She bailed? Oh my God, she is so fired.

893
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:14,648
Maybe Pooka got her.

894
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:16,068
Oh my God, here we go.

895
00:50:19,659 --> 00:50:21,579
Maybe it's the babysitter?

896
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:32,668
Matt, what the hell?

897
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:34,048
What are you doing here, Bennie?

898
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:36,219
I came to talk to Derrick
about that phone number

899
00:50:36,219 --> 00:50:38,179
since he wasn't answering my calls.

900
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:41,889
What, did something happen?

901
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:46,018
Pooka attacked me at the office.

902
00:50:46,019 --> 00:50:47,478
We think it's Ellie's ghost.

903
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,358
No, that...

904
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,018
that's what Molly thinks.

905
00:50:52,019 --> 00:50:55,068
Matt, Ellie murdered her husband

906
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:57,148
- and burnt herself alive...
- And that means now

907
00:50:57,150 --> 00:50:59,715
that there's a toy roaming
the streets killing people?

908
00:50:59,717 --> 00:51:02,739
No, it means that
her spirit is not at rest,

909
00:51:02,739 --> 00:51:05,869
and that ritual we made
could be channeling it

910
00:51:05,869 --> 00:51:08,579
and manifesting as Pooka.

911
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,708
So what did you find out?

912
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:14,918
Well I traced the phone number
that's been harassing you.

913
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,918
It belongs to some kid
named Andy Jorgensen.

914
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,679
- Andy?
- He works at SCI.

915
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,048
I mean, the guy's a douchebag,

916
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:23,309
but I don't think he'd
actually attack anybody.

917
00:51:23,309 --> 00:51:24,849
Well, I tracked the phone number.

918
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:26,429
He's at Ellie's old place right now.

919
00:51:26,429 --> 00:51:28,688
I'm gonna go check it out and
I'll let you know what I find.

920
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:30,849
No, no, no, it's
not safe for you, Bennie.

921
00:51:30,849 --> 00:51:32,728
This is not something you can arrest.

922
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:34,237
Whatever that thing is,

923
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:36,938
it is not just some
kid wearing a costume.

924
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,858
Okay, Derrick, take a breath, calm down.

925
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,858
Okay, listen, if it's a ghost,

926
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:42,489
then the only way to get rid of it

927
00:51:42,489 --> 00:51:44,528
is to purify the place where it died.

928
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:46,869
So, here, okay.

929
00:51:46,869 --> 00:51:48,958
You burn the sage, you
sprinkle the salt...

930
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,289
- Guys, I don't think...
- Burn the sage

931
00:51:50,289 --> 00:51:51,668
- and sprinkle the salt?
- I'm coming with you.

932
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:53,411
If this is because of
the ritual, I did it too.

933
00:51:53,414 --> 00:51:54,998
- Guys.
- So I want to help.

934
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,338
- You did it?
- Okay!

935
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:59,798
Everybody take a breath and calm down.

936
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,048
This is getting ridiculous.

937
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:03,509
For once in my life, I agree with Matt.

938
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:04,639
Wow.

939
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:06,389
There are no such thing as ghosts.

940
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:09,018
Okay, so I am going to Ellie's
and I am bringing in Andy

941
00:52:09,019 --> 00:52:10,809
because I am an officer of the law.

942
00:52:10,809 --> 00:52:13,018
Now, if you two want to
come with me, that's fine,

943
00:52:13,019 --> 00:52:14,858
only because I know
you'll follow me anyway.

944
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,648
That's true. All right.

945
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:18,608
Call us if you need any help, okay?

946
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:20,489
Yeah, and be careful of the spirits

947
00:52:20,489 --> 00:52:22,739
and the ghosts and the goblins.

948
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:24,909
And the Easter Bunny, and Santa Claus,

949
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:27,579
- and elves and shit.
- Never having sex again.

950
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:43,679
Not creepy at all.

951
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:45,259
I'm gonna check it out.

952
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:46,849
Stay behind me.

953
00:53:01,989 --> 00:53:04,449
You still have that
old thing I gave you?

954
00:53:04,449 --> 00:53:07,409
It was your, uh, goodbye present to me.

955
00:53:07,409 --> 00:53:09,409
You know I bought it for like five bucks

956
00:53:09,409 --> 00:53:11,039
at Claire's, right?

957
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,998
Sentimental value.

958
00:53:16,789 --> 00:53:18,748
No sign of a break-in.

959
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:22,009
Well, how are we gonna get in?

960
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:23,378
Oh, wait, did...

961
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:25,469
did I just hear someone call for help?

962
00:53:25,469 --> 00:53:27,940
What? No, I... I didn't hear anything.

963
00:53:27,942 --> 00:53:29,559
- I don't think so.
- No, I definitely heard

964
00:53:29,559 --> 00:53:31,469
someone call for help.

965
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:35,018
It's a cop thing.

966
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:45,277
Oh, okay, okay, there is a Burmese demon

967
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,568
called a Belu

968
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:48,449
that shapeshifts and eats people.

969
00:53:48,449 --> 00:53:49,989
- Maybe it's one of those.
- Yeah.

970
00:53:49,989 --> 00:53:51,489
Oh, you should probably
call Ghostbusters.

971
00:53:51,489 --> 00:53:53,199
Maybe they can figure it out.

972
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:55,869
Okay, what's with
the condescending attitude?

973
00:53:55,869 --> 00:53:57,958
No, uh... sorry, you're right.

974
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,418
Let's just jump to the conclusion

975
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:01,048
that ghosts and demons exist

976
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:03,719
and they're stalking our friends.

977
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:06,219
I remember when you loved
that I was into this stuff,

978
00:54:06,219 --> 00:54:08,009
and now it just seems to annoy you.

979
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:10,759
I just wish you were a bit
more realistic sometimes.

980
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,719
- What?
- Molly, our daughter

981
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:15,139
believes she has an invisible
friend because of you.

982
00:54:15,139 --> 00:54:16,978
- So?
- She's 8 years old, Moll!

983
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,268
She shouldn't be learning
about Tibetan mysticism.

984
00:54:19,269 --> 00:54:20,648
Oh, I'm sorry

985
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:22,188
that I think there's more to the world

986
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:24,438
than drinking beer and
watching television.

987
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,528
Oh my God, look, it's not a demon.

988
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:31,199
It's just some people
being idiots online.

989
00:54:34,789 --> 00:54:37,208
Well, it's clear we
see things differently.

990
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:39,208
Oh my God.

991
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:41,289
Mom, Dad?

992
00:54:41,289 --> 00:54:43,298
- Hey, bud.
- Hey, baby.

993
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,958
Did you have another bad dream?

994
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,219
No.

995
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:51,509
There's someone in my room.

996
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:06,148
So, um, what is it
that we're looking for?

997
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:07,778
Some sign of Pooka.

998
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,318
No, we're looking to see

999
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,119
if a person has been here recently.

1000
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:13,539
I'm probably the first
black guy to say this to a cop,

1001
00:55:13,539 --> 00:55:16,199
but I'd feel a lot safer
if you'd take out your gun.

1002
00:55:16,199 --> 00:55:17,409
I don't know, man.

1003
00:55:17,409 --> 00:55:19,458
I didn't pack my silver bullets.

1004
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,168
Hey, look.

1005
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,559
So this is where it happened.

1006
00:55:40,849 --> 00:55:42,809
Jenni and I saw something.

1007
00:55:42,809 --> 00:55:45,858
No, Jenni, you just
imagined you saw something.

1008
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:48,949
But it's Pooka, he was watching me.

1009
00:55:48,949 --> 00:55:50,239
No, baby, we told you

1010
00:55:50,239 --> 00:55:51,949
that was just a story we made up.

1011
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:54,489
- Becky did it.
- Becky did what?

1012
00:55:54,489 --> 00:55:56,739
She did the dance and put it online

1013
00:55:56,739 --> 00:55:58,329
and now she's gone.

1014
00:56:02,289 --> 00:56:04,418
Honey...

1015
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:05,918
where is Becky?

1016
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,088
Moll, no, stop, just watch Lauren.

1017
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:09,338
I'm gonna check the room.

1018
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:10,429
No.

1019
00:56:10,429 --> 00:56:11,429
No, Matt!

1020
00:56:11,431 --> 00:56:12,838
Matt, don't you go in that room!

1021
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,798
Molly, look at me!

1022
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,018
Monsters don't exist!

1023
00:56:17,019 --> 00:56:18,139
What...

1024
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:22,478
I can't believe I'm
the bad guy in this situation.

1025
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:29,568
Was that a phone?

1026
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:31,199
If ghosts had phones.

1027
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:41,119
Damn light bulbs.

1028
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:45,918
Where'd you say you saw it?

1029
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,208
In the closet.

1030
00:57:01,179 --> 00:57:03,228
"You've been naughty".

1031
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:04,599
Police.

1032
00:57:04,599 --> 00:57:06,478
This is the police. Show yourself.

1033
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:26,039
I guess we can rule out Andy.

1034
00:57:26,039 --> 00:57:28,088
I think that's safe to say.

1035
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:27,768
All right, I'm gonna
have to call this in.

1036
00:58:27,769 --> 00:58:30,688
Call this in.

1037
00:58:36,699 --> 00:58:38,568
Susan...

1038
00:59:07,059 --> 00:59:08,768
Bennie!

1039
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:12,018
Fuck!

1040
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:15,398
Shit!

1041
00:59:17,699 --> 00:59:18,739
Matt, Matt!

1042
00:59:18,739 --> 00:59:20,489
You stay here.

1043
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:22,989
Holy shit!

1044
00:59:22,989 --> 00:59:24,619
Holy shit, what is that thing?

1045
00:59:24,619 --> 00:59:25,949
Ah, holy shit!

1046
00:59:25,949 --> 00:59:28,119
- And what is it wearing?
- What's wrong?

1047
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:29,789
Uh, nothing.

1048
00:59:29,789 --> 00:59:31,668
Get downstairs now.

1049
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:43,429
Go, go, go!

1050
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:54,141
Well, Molly, I think
it's safe to say that

1051
00:59:54,143 --> 00:59:56,527
- you were probably right.
- Probably?

1052
00:59:58,190 --> 00:59:59,239
Get outta here now!

1053
00:59:59,239 --> 01:00:01,528
No, no, Bennie, we are not leaving you.

1054
01:00:02,619 --> 01:00:04,619
Hey, asshole!

1055
01:00:05,909 --> 01:00:07,199
That was not even close.

1056
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:09,119
Uh, yeah, writer here.

1057
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,168
Hey!

1058
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:20,378
No, not my Himalayan salt crystal!

1059
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:23,469
Go, go, go, go, go!

1060
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:26,969
What's wrong?

1061
01:00:26,969 --> 01:00:28,429
Uh, nothing.

1062
01:00:28,429 --> 01:00:30,018
It's just a really big rat.

1063
01:00:30,019 --> 01:00:32,398
- You're going to stab it?
- Yeah, it's a big monster rat.

1064
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,228
Now get in the pantry. Go, go, go!

1065
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,699
Be gone, evil spirit!

1066
01:00:44,909 --> 01:00:46,369
Aren't you supposed to light it?

1067
01:00:46,369 --> 01:00:47,989
I don't know!

1068
01:00:47,989 --> 01:00:50,159
Shit, shit!

1069
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:51,579
Hey!

1070
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:55,458
Damn it, Molly!

1071
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:57,208
God damn it, you guys!

1072
01:01:05,929 --> 01:01:07,099
Great idea, Matt.

1073
01:01:07,099 --> 01:01:09,719
Now we're in a small room with no exit!

1074
01:01:09,719 --> 01:01:12,268
- What do we do now?
- I don't know!

1075
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:16,809
Is that Becky?

1076
01:01:16,809 --> 01:01:17,938
It's okay, baby.

1077
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,398
She's just napping.

1078
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,148
What?

1079
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:37,998
Guys?

1080
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,878
The hole!

1081
01:01:45,969 --> 01:01:47,048
He needs a doctor.

1082
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:48,929
Let's get him the hell outta here.

1083
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:55,849
Go see if it's gone.

1084
01:01:55,849 --> 01:01:56,978
Wow.

1085
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:58,358
What?

1086
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:11,239
What?

1087
01:02:11,239 --> 01:02:12,789
Hey, are you okay?

1088
01:02:12,789 --> 01:02:14,789
No, yeah, neither am I.

1089
01:02:19,539 --> 01:02:20,958
Oh no.

1090
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,628
What?

1091
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:23,670
It's Bennie.

1092
01:02:28,585 --> 01:02:30,114
Jesus, Amir.

1093
01:02:30,115 --> 01:02:32,007
It's like 2 a.m. Why
are you still awake?

1094
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:34,099
Is this really the safest
place you could think of?

1095
01:02:34,099 --> 01:02:36,518
- What? It's our spot.
- Hey, guys.

1096
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,018
What happened to Bennie?

1097
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,010
Hey, bud, do you want to see

1098
01:02:42,012 --> 01:02:43,648
if you can try and
beat Daddy's high score

1099
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:45,648
on the old video game
over there, Gut Wrencher?

1100
01:02:45,650 --> 01:02:48,989
You're going to talk about
adult stuff, aren't you?

1101
01:02:48,989 --> 01:02:50,239
Yeah, we are.

1102
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:51,579
Here you go.

1103
01:02:53,159 --> 01:02:54,659
Come on, Jenni.

1104
01:02:57,369 --> 01:02:59,498
That kid's gonna need some
therapy when we're all done.

1105
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,579
Yeah.

1106
01:03:00,579 --> 01:03:02,378
So we took Bennie to the hospital,

1107
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:03,798
so he's gonna be okay.

1108
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:04,918
Pooka attacked him.

1109
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,509
Which was incredibly difficult

1110
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:07,929
to explain to the police,

1111
01:03:07,929 --> 01:03:09,679
but at least we know it wasn't Andy,

1112
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:11,639
and your magic herbs and
spices didn't do jack.

1113
01:03:11,639 --> 01:03:14,268
Well, Pooka showed up at our house too.

1114
01:03:14,269 --> 01:03:15,929
He was in Lauren's closet.

1115
01:03:15,929 --> 01:03:18,728
And he, uh...

1116
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:20,309
he killed our babysitter.

1117
01:03:20,309 --> 01:03:21,728
What?

1118
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:23,768
Oh my God.

1119
01:03:23,769 --> 01:03:25,818
Wait, if Pooka was at your house, too,

1120
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:28,608
can ghosts show up
in two places at once?

1121
01:03:28,610 --> 01:03:30,278
I don't think so.

1122
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:33,278
And why was it wearing those,
like, German kid shorts?

1123
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,173
- What?
- Those German shorts,

1124
01:03:35,175 --> 01:03:37,119
the ones, like the high
ones that German kids wear,

1125
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:38,289
with the suspenders on them.

1126
01:03:38,289 --> 01:03:39,369
What are you talking about?

1127
01:03:39,369 --> 01:03:40,789
The stupid, like, German kid shorts,

1128
01:03:40,789 --> 01:03:42,248
the green ones with the straps...

1129
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:44,128
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

1130
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:46,009
What?

1131
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:47,878
I think I figured it out.

1132
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:50,429
What?

1133
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:56,099
I think the internet
literally created a monster.

1134
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:01,648
The fuck are you talking about, Derrick?

1135
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:03,559
Just listen to me, all right?

1136
01:04:03,559 --> 01:04:05,117
There's the original Pooka, right?

1137
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,438
That's the one that attacked Susan.

1138
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:08,858
But then people kept
adding stuff to the story,

1139
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:10,148
like claws.

1140
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:11,818
That's the one that attacked me.

1141
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:13,778
Tonight, the one that attacked you guys.

1142
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:15,311
- Did it look like this?
- Yes.

1143
01:04:15,313 --> 01:04:17,159
That's the fan art that went viral!

1144
01:04:17,159 --> 01:04:18,789
That's the German kid shorts!

1145
01:04:18,789 --> 01:04:20,248
So you're saying that whatever people

1146
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:22,498
are talking about online is coming true?

1147
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,838
Not everything, I think.

1148
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:26,748
Just the stuff that's super popular.

1149
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:27,798
Oh my God.

1150
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,128
Oh my God, that's it, that's it!

1151
01:04:30,130 --> 01:04:31,838
It's a Tulpa.

1152
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,088
- A what?
- What?

1153
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:35,509
Okay, so, Tulpas were
created by Tibetan monks.

1154
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:37,059
They would focus their
thoughts on creating

1155
01:04:37,059 --> 01:04:38,719
spiritual companions to aid them.

1156
01:04:38,719 --> 01:04:41,059
- Like Jenni?
- Mmm, kind of.

1157
01:04:41,059 --> 01:04:42,809
Tulpas are completely autonomous,

1158
01:04:42,809 --> 01:04:44,358
so your thoughts give it life

1159
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,268
but you don't necessarily control it.

1160
01:04:46,269 --> 01:04:48,068
Like Fight Club!

1161
01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:49,938
Yes, like Fight Club.

1162
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:51,318
I mean, it tracks.

1163
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:54,449
If the internet is making
everyone think of something,

1164
01:04:54,449 --> 01:04:56,159
then that could create a Tulpa.

1165
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:58,869
Yeah, so if a bunch of
shitheads online are doing it,

1166
01:04:58,869 --> 01:05:01,248
of course it's evil, but
how do we get rid of it?

1167
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:03,829
Oh, well, that's easy.
You just get everybody to...

1168
01:05:03,829 --> 01:05:05,708
stop thinking about it.

1169
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:08,048
Guys, whatever we're gonna
do, we better do it now.

1170
01:05:08,050 --> 01:05:09,458
Oh, God, what now?

1171
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:10,878
Someone just posted a story

1172
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,298
about the Pooka unveiling.

1173
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:15,469
It says once the new toy is shown off,

1174
01:05:15,469 --> 01:05:17,719
all the old ones are gonna come to life

1175
01:05:17,719 --> 01:05:20,679
and wipe out humanity.

1176
01:05:20,679 --> 01:05:23,389
They're saying it's Pooka's
revenge for trying to change it.

1177
01:05:23,389 --> 01:05:24,559
Oh my God.

1178
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:27,309
The event... it's today.

1179
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,358
What if Pooka shows
up at your mom's house?

1180
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,858
My mom still has dial-up internet.

1181
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:36,119
I'm pretty sure she's not gonna
do any internet challenges.

1182
01:05:36,119 --> 01:05:37,489
Lauren will be safe there.

1183
01:05:37,489 --> 01:05:40,329
Hey, I wouldn't suggest
having a drink right now, Matt.

1184
01:05:40,329 --> 01:05:42,708
If I'm gonna get murdered
by some demonic toy,

1185
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:44,998
I'm gonna be buzzed
when it happens, okay?

1186
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,579
I don't understand.

1187
01:05:46,579 --> 01:05:48,628
There's been viral stuff before.

1188
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:52,088
How come we've never seen,
like, a monster Grumpy Cat?

1189
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:53,418
Well, maybe because

1190
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:55,759
it has Ellie's ghost's help.

1191
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:56,969
Okay, okay,

1192
01:05:56,969 --> 01:05:59,009
so we just need
something else to go viral

1193
01:05:59,010 --> 01:06:00,849
to get people to stop
talking about Pooka.

1194
01:06:00,849 --> 01:06:02,059
I don't know that we can.

1195
01:06:02,059 --> 01:06:04,059
There's even a link
to watch a live stream

1196
01:06:04,059 --> 01:06:05,599
of the event.

1197
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:09,438
If only we didn't make
the story so scary.

1198
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,402
That's it!

1199
01:06:11,403 --> 01:06:12,943
- What's it?
- Uh, the story.

1200
01:06:12,945 --> 01:06:14,358
We just change the story!

1201
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:15,608
Well, it's already out there.

1202
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:17,528
Okay, but the story that I read Lauren

1203
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:19,619
with the bears, I just
change the ending for her,

1204
01:06:19,619 --> 01:06:21,699
so we just do the same thing with Pooka.

1205
01:06:21,699 --> 01:06:23,539
So we just write that Pooka is dead

1206
01:06:23,539 --> 01:06:25,248
and then that's it?

1207
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:27,958
No, that won't exactly
get people talking.

1208
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:29,958
What if we give it a silver bullet?

1209
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:32,248
We invent something that
can actually kill Pooka.

1210
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:33,628
The original Pooka doll.

1211
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:35,219
We could use that as a weak spot.

1212
01:06:35,219 --> 01:06:36,969
Yes! Amir keeps it in his office.

1213
01:06:36,969 --> 01:06:38,798
We could just say
that you have to burn it,

1214
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,349
the same way Ellie did with her husband.

1215
01:06:40,349 --> 01:06:42,139
Say that you have to
do it by the unveiling,

1216
01:06:42,139 --> 01:06:43,389
otherwise it won't work.

1217
01:06:43,389 --> 01:06:44,889
People love a climactic ending.

1218
01:06:46,639 --> 01:06:49,391
Look, we'll head to
launch, then we'll split up.

1219
01:06:49,393 --> 01:06:51,268
Matt, Molly, you guys get the doll.

1220
01:06:51,269 --> 01:06:53,688
Susan, we're gonna have
to wreck that event.

1221
01:06:53,690 --> 01:06:55,239
I'm so ready for a new job.

1222
01:06:55,239 --> 01:06:56,568
All right, let's do this.

1223
01:06:56,570 --> 01:06:57,699
Go...

1224
01:06:57,699 --> 01:06:59,739
- We are not doing that.
- Okay.

1225
01:06:59,739 --> 01:07:03,967
_

1226
01:07:03,969 --> 01:07:09,621
_

1227
01:07:09,623 --> 01:07:15,175
_

1228
01:07:15,177 --> 01:07:16,338
_

1229
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:18,509
We've got an hour until
the presentation starts.

1230
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:20,838
The story's still holding up, for now.

1231
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:23,599
Remember, the doll is in Amir's office.

1232
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:25,059
We got this.

1233
01:07:30,099 --> 01:07:31,858
I'm still seeing some marks here,

1234
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:33,478
so I really need those cleaned up.

1235
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:35,108
Susan, hi!

1236
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:37,188
So great of you to show
up to your own event

1237
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:39,608
after ducking my calls
for the last 24 hours.

1238
01:07:39,610 --> 01:07:41,757
Wow, Amir, I am so sorry

1239
01:07:41,759 --> 01:07:44,409
I didn't respond to
your 800 texts at 2 a.m.

1240
01:07:44,409 --> 01:07:46,159
No, it's just good for me to know

1241
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:47,958
that Pooka isn't your
number one priority,

1242
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:48,960
so, awesome.

1243
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,208
And you, thank you so much

1244
01:07:50,210 --> 01:07:51,958
for not finishing that speech of mine!

1245
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,708
You can consider yourself fired.

1246
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:55,748
Shit, this was my dream job.

1247
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:57,878
Amir, listen. You cannot
present that toy.

1248
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,719
People are saying that something awful

1249
01:07:59,719 --> 01:08:01,139
is gonna happen at the unveiling.

1250
01:08:01,139 --> 01:08:03,009
Yeah, of course they are.

1251
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:04,849
We posted that.

1252
01:08:04,849 --> 01:08:07,349
The whole "Pooka Monster"
trend was so popular,

1253
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:10,309
we figured an apocalypse would
really get people to tune in.

1254
01:08:10,309 --> 01:08:13,188
It's just a story, Susan, calm down!

1255
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:15,438
All right, guys. Let's go, people!

1256
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:19,279
Let's open the doors
and let everyone in here!

1257
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:21,698
- I really hate him.
- Yeah, I get that.

1258
01:08:23,319 --> 01:08:25,948
Okay, Susan said left.

1259
01:08:25,949 --> 01:08:28,698
No, she said right, she said right.

1260
01:08:28,699 --> 01:08:30,038
Which door is it?

1261
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:32,038
Uh... that one feels right.

1262
01:08:32,039 --> 01:08:34,788
What do you mean, "feels right"?

1263
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:39,298
All right, testing, testing, testing!

1264
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:41,679
Hello, Pooka Nation!

1265
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:44,719
Yeah!

1266
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:48,219
Are you guys ready
for some exciting news?

1267
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:49,639
Yeah, you are.

1268
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:51,269
No, no, no, he can't go on yet,

1269
01:08:51,270 --> 01:08:54,269
he can't show the toy,
we haven't done the thing.

1270
01:08:54,270 --> 01:08:55,649
Oh no.

1271
01:08:55,649 --> 01:08:57,479
They're saying that we
didn't get the story right.

1272
01:08:57,479 --> 01:08:59,439
David Burgis wasn't burned alive.

1273
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:00,899
He was stabbed to death!

1274
01:09:04,449 --> 01:09:06,698
We have to stab the doll?

1275
01:09:06,699 --> 01:09:08,038
Yes.

1276
01:09:11,659 --> 01:09:13,328
- That'll work.
- We gotta stop Matt

1277
01:09:13,329 --> 01:09:14,998
and Molly before they burn that doll.

1278
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,038
What are you doing?

1279
01:09:16,039 --> 01:09:17,418
They gotta see it.

1280
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,588
I'm gonna live stream the whole thing.

1281
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:21,969
Stall, I'm gonna find Matt and Molly.

1282
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:24,588
Stall.

1283
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:29,679
What is that, Moll?

1284
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:30,929
It's a prayer stick.

1285
01:09:30,930 --> 01:09:32,849
It wards off evil.

1286
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:35,399
Isn't that kinda cultural appropriation?

1287
01:09:35,399 --> 01:09:38,399
- Is it?
- I don't know, is it?

1288
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:40,279
Oh, there it is.

1289
01:09:50,949 --> 01:09:52,908
Fucking just... let's
burn it right here.

1290
01:09:52,909 --> 01:09:54,498
Okay.

1291
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:19,399
Matt, stay down!

1292
01:10:22,569 --> 01:10:24,448
See, it wards off evil.

1293
01:10:24,449 --> 01:10:27,109
We here at Spectacular Contraptions

1294
01:10:27,109 --> 01:10:29,618
really pride ourselves in bringing you

1295
01:10:29,619 --> 01:10:32,158
the best in kids' enjoyment,

1296
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:35,958
which is why we love Pooka!

1297
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,918
Are you nice? Are you naughty?

1298
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,088
Only Pooka knows!

1299
01:10:42,090 --> 01:10:43,168
Hi!

1300
01:10:43,170 --> 01:10:44,911
Hi, um, so sorry, Amir.

1301
01:10:44,912 --> 01:10:46,719
I was wondering if I
could say a few words.

1302
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,088
No, no, that's okay, thank you.

1303
01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:49,969
No, but I do have something
really important to add.

1304
01:10:49,970 --> 01:10:51,509
No, we're good, I'm handling it...

1305
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:53,269
It'll just be one second.

1306
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,389
Hi, um...

1307
01:10:56,390 --> 01:10:59,689
So, I just really...

1308
01:10:59,689 --> 01:11:02,359
wanted to reflect on Pooka.

1309
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:22,748
The last place I want to be

1310
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:24,759
if all these Pooka dolls come to life.

1311
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:28,929
That looks bad, Matt.

1312
01:11:28,930 --> 01:11:30,298
Eh...

1313
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:31,969
"It's only a flesh wound".

1314
01:11:41,229 --> 01:11:42,729
I meant it, by the way.

1315
01:11:42,729 --> 01:11:43,769
What?

1316
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:45,939
That I love your quirks.

1317
01:11:45,939 --> 01:11:49,859
No, I'm gonna try and be better
and more open to that shit.

1318
01:11:49,859 --> 01:11:51,488
Just the candles and the salts

1319
01:11:51,489 --> 01:11:53,238
and all the rocks and stuff like that.

1320
01:11:53,239 --> 01:11:55,578
I just... I love you.

1321
01:11:55,579 --> 01:11:58,868
And, um, you were clearly
right about all this stuff.

1322
01:11:58,869 --> 01:12:00,038
No, no, listen.

1323
01:12:00,039 --> 01:12:01,918
This is... this is a lot,

1324
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:05,128
and, uh, I can be a lot.

1325
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:07,009
- But I love you...
- Shh, shush.

1326
01:12:07,010 --> 01:12:09,338
- Did you just shush me?
- No, no, shut up, shut up.

1327
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:11,088
Listen, listen.

1328
01:12:29,029 --> 01:12:30,359
Oh, thank God, okay...

1329
01:12:30,359 --> 01:12:31,859
Oh, fuck.

1330
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:40,368
When I think about my
first experience with Pooka,

1331
01:12:40,369 --> 01:12:44,458
well, I was in my thirties,
but I felt like a kid again.

1332
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,208
That's fine, I think we got it.

1333
01:12:46,210 --> 01:12:47,838
No, I think we got it. Very moving.

1334
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,878
Very moving, great story.

1335
01:12:55,850 --> 01:12:57,139
Oh, shit!

1336
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,269
Burn the fucking doll, Molly!

1337
01:13:01,270 --> 01:13:03,019
I lost the original.

1338
01:13:04,609 --> 01:13:07,439
Hey, you fucked-up Easter Bunny.

1339
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:12,399
Come get some.

1340
01:13:15,029 --> 01:13:17,448
- What are you doing?
- We gotta stab the doll.

1341
01:13:17,449 --> 01:13:19,198
Wait, I thought we
were supposed to burn it!

1342
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:20,618
Yeah, well, they changed the story.

1343
01:13:20,619 --> 01:13:22,618
- Oh...
- We gotta live stream it too.

1344
01:13:22,619 --> 01:13:23,918
Matt, here.

1345
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:28,958
Derrick, there's fucking
thousands of people watching

1346
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,048
but they're all fucking
rooting for Pooka.

1347
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:32,878
Uh... here, catch!

1348
01:13:39,930 --> 01:13:41,309
It's not working!

1349
01:13:41,310 --> 01:13:43,019
Sorry, it's the wrong one!

1350
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:54,448
Can you hurry up and find the right one?

1351
01:13:54,449 --> 01:13:55,988
I am trying!

1352
01:13:57,239 --> 01:13:58,908
Is this it?

1353
01:14:02,699 --> 01:14:04,998
I'm sorry, they all look the same!

1354
01:14:30,359 --> 01:14:32,479
How's he doing?

1355
01:14:33,899 --> 01:14:35,899
I don't know, I can't see anything.

1356
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:39,118
Oh, shit, there he is.

1357
01:14:39,119 --> 01:14:40,279
He's not doing good!

1358
01:14:40,279 --> 01:14:41,538
Oh...

1359
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:11,059
Oh, God.

1360
01:15:13,729 --> 01:15:15,359
Get off my ex!

1361
01:15:16,489 --> 01:15:18,198
Holy shit!

1362
01:15:18,199 --> 01:15:19,698
What, what, what? What is happening?

1363
01:15:19,699 --> 01:15:21,738
It's Susan, she's kicking Pooka's ass!

1364
01:15:21,739 --> 01:15:24,238
I can't believe I'm missing all of this!

1365
01:15:30,579 --> 01:15:31,748
No.

1366
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:39,429
Susan.

1367
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:40,759
Susan.

1368
01:15:41,850 --> 01:15:42,889
Oh my God.

1369
01:15:42,890 --> 01:15:44,719
I found it, I found it!

1370
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,679
Give me Pooka, now!

1371
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:51,729
Where's the scissors?

1372
01:16:03,579 --> 01:16:05,238
Bennie!

1373
01:16:05,239 --> 01:16:07,748
God damn, he's so fucking hot.

1374
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:09,498
Sorry I'm late.

1375
01:16:13,539 --> 01:16:15,628
Bennie, scissors!

1376
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,139
You're canceled.

1377
01:16:55,539 --> 01:16:58,048
So how long have you been
rehearsing that line in your head?

1378
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:01,798
How'd you find us?

1379
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,219
I saw your live stream.

1380
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:06,179
Looked like you could use some help.

1381
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:09,019
Wanna cut me a break?
I just killed a demon.

1382
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:11,349
No, you can't do everything.

1383
01:17:17,359 --> 01:17:19,529
Hey, can we go home now?

1384
01:17:19,529 --> 01:17:20,819
It worked.

1385
01:17:20,819 --> 01:17:22,238
We killed Pooka.

1386
01:17:23,569 --> 01:17:25,698
Let me check on the unveiling.

1387
01:17:27,829 --> 01:17:29,908
Without further ado,

1388
01:17:29,909 --> 01:17:34,578
I bring you the new Pooka!

1389
01:17:43,550 --> 01:17:45,338
Wait, guys,

1390
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:47,259
#apookalypse is trending.

1391
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:56,189
Yeah, Pooka!

1392
01:17:56,189 --> 01:17:58,019
What happened?

1393
01:17:59,859 --> 01:18:01,359
No, no, no, no, no.

1394
01:18:01,359 --> 01:18:03,698
We did... we did the
thing, we did the thing!

1395
01:18:03,699 --> 01:18:04,859
It's the internet.

1396
01:18:04,859 --> 01:18:06,698
They won't let Pooka die.

1397
01:18:09,619 --> 01:18:11,618
Hey, guys...

1398
01:18:11,619 --> 01:18:13,158
it's happening.

1399
01:18:13,159 --> 01:18:14,868
They're coming to life.

1400
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:30,099
You said nothing interesting
ever happens in Spring Valley.

1401
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:32,469
I'll never say anything
bad about home again.
