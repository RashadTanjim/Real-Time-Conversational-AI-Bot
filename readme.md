# Real-Time Conversational AI Bot Based on Bengali Language

This project aims to build a real-time conversational AI bot that leverages the Bengali language and is designed to engage in interactive dialogues with users. Built using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the bot can understand and respond in Bengali, making it suitable for various applications, including customer support, education, and general information retrieval. The bot uses state-of-the-art machine learning models to interpret user input, offering a seamless conversational experience while continuously improving through user interactions.

## Features:
- Real-time communication with Bengali language support
- Intelligent response generation using machine learning models
- Customizable for various domains (e.g., customer service, education, etc.)
- Support for continuous learning and improvement

## Technologies Used:
- NLP and AI frameworks (such as TensorFlow)
- Bengali language datasets for training

Feel free to explore, contribute, and enhance this project to create more advanced language models!
